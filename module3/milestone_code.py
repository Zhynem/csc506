"""
Prompt:
In the portfolio project, retroactive search trees will be implemented - both partially and fully 
retroactive search trees. The update operations to the (non-retroactive) search tree should be 
Insert(x) and Delete(x), and the query operation should be Pred(x) that returns the largest element 
stored in the subtree â‰¤x. 

The task of Milestone 1 is to:
 - Define an appropriate interface to a partially and a fully retroactive search tree.
